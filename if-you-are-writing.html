			<h1>If You Are Writing an Essay or a Thesis</h1>
			<p class="author"> Chappell Ellison, 2016</p>

		<section class="poem">
			<section class="stanza">
				<p>If you are writing an essay or a thesis</p>
				<p>Don’t start by researching.</p>
				<p>Start by writing.</p>
				<p>How else will you know what you’re looking for?</p>
			</section>
			<section class="stanza">
				<p>If you are writing an essay or a thesis</p>
				<p>And it’s about an object</p>
				<p>Acquire that object if you can.</p>
				<p>See what it’s like to touch it</p>
				<p>And live with it.</p>
				<p>Witness how others react to it.</p>
				<p>See if you can break it or make it better.</p>
				<p>See if it changes your mind.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="stanza">
				<p>If you are writing an essay or a thesis</p>
				<p>Ask someone else what they think about the topic.</p>
				<p>Ask your mother, your spouse, a cousin.</p>
				<p>Ask a postal worker, an electrician, a hair stylist.</p>
				<p>Ask a stranger.</p>
				<p>Ask someone whose first language isn’t the same as yours.</p>
				<p>Truly listen to them.</p>
				<p>Listen until you hear the story they have to tell.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="stanza">
				<p>If you are writing an essay or a thesis</p>
				<p>Don’t build it with the bones of a dead person’s theories.</p>
				<p>Instead, let that person be a ghost that sometimes haunts the spaces between your sentences.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="stanza">
				<p>If you are writing an essay or a thesis</p>
				<p>Start by writing the last paragraph.</p>
				<p>You might find that it becomes your first.</p>
				<p>Eventually you might find that in writing</p>
				<p>There is no first or last.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="stanza">
				<p>If you are writing an essay or a thesis</p>
				<p>Let go of the idea that you need to say everything.</p>
				<p>Choose one window through which to view your topic.</p>
				<p>Make it your window.</p>
				<p>Hang drapes and pull up a chair.</p>
				<p>Don’t worry about the window to your right or the other one to your left.</p>
				<p>Those windows are for other writers.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<p>If you are writing an essay or a thesis</p>
				<p>Don’t think of it as an essay or a thesis.</p>
				<p>Think of it as a really engaging conversation.</p>
				<p>One you might have with a friend</p>
				<p>Until you look at the clock and can’t believe how late it is.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="stanza">
				<p>If you are writing an essay or a thesis</p>
				<p>Remember that you have read and written thousands of words before this day.</p>
				<p>And that you will read and write thousands more words after this day.</p>
				<p>Today is another day you get to spend with words.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="stanza">
				<p>If you are writing an essay or a thesis</p>
				<p>Make discovery of the new your goal.</p>
				<p>Not reheating the frozen goods of the past.</p>
				<p>Make as much of your meal from scratch as you can.</p>
				<p>This is healthy for you</p>
				<p>And it tastes much better in the end.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="stanza">
				<p>If you are writing an essay or thesis</p>
				<p>Know that you do not have to act on every idea.</p>
				<p>Some ideas are meant to be leaves</p>
				<p>Floating by on the surface of a river.</p>
				<p>Just let them go.</p>
				<p>If the idea is truly important to you</p>
				<p>It will float by again.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="stanza">
				<p>If you are writing an essay or a thesis</p>
				<p>Do not feel disheartened</p>
				<p>When you discover others have written about the same topic.</p>
				<p>Remember, they are looking through their window</p>
				<p>And you are looking through yours.</p>
				<p>No one else’s window has your drapes.</p>
				<p>Or thickness of pane.</p>
				<p>Write from your window</p>
				<p>As no one else can.</p>
