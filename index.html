			<h2>In a rapidly changing world, how do we gain strength in our adaptibility?</h2>
			<p class="dropcap">While reading and choosing texts that would be suitable for a theme that resonates with my personal career history, I kept in mind how we as designers can use both our design and non-design skills to our strength while working on projects. This was an aspect of my initial choice of text - <strong>What Is Code</strong> - that resonated with me very strongly, as a designer who has come from a non-design background. How might we, as designers, learn from the fields we work alongside to best communicate our work? How can we be successful team players when our teammates who are not in technical roles do not always understand <em>our</em> roles?</p>
			<p>In Ellison's text, they state that one should "Ask a stranger" or "someone whose  first language isn’t the same as yours" before starting a writing piece. I think this philosophy can be applied to good design practice also, after all, when we user test products we must ask our <em>users</em> and not just our fellow designers.</p>
			<p>While reading these texts, I encourage you to reflect on how our non-design skills can make us stronger designers.

			<p class="pullquote">How can we leverage what we learn outside of the design space in our creative lives?</p>
			<p>With this in mind, Burdick's text can give us more insight into our our non-design colleagues may think and how we can not only help them <em>understand our world</em> but also <em><strong>use design-thinking to the overall benefit</strong></em>. With this lens, these texts as a collectio reflect not only how designers can best communicate with those outside our field but also help others use a framework for thinking that can be applicable past the design process.</p>
