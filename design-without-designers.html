			<p>Hello. The talk that I’m going to do today was initially prepared for a conference on the future of art and design education in the 21st century, held at the University of Brighton, in England. While speaking to a British audience, it became clear that my talk was really a rallying cry for the American design education community, none of whom happened to be in the audience at the time. So I’m happy to be able to deliver it here today where I hope to provoke educators into action—or at the very least begin a conversation.</p>
			<p>As the Chair of the graduate Media Design Program at Art Center College of Design, many assume that I bring a tech-oriented vision of the future. But surprisingly, the design futures that I foresee are not informed by work with alpha technologies, industry research labs, or human-centered research. Instead it is the work I do as a designer in the realms of computational linguistics, literary science, electronic literature, and media theory and criticism that has given me a glimpse of what may lie ahead. Within these scholarly communities I find myself in the role of design ambassador to fields that are undergoing transformation due to changes in technology, culture, and theory. And it is this experience that has shown me the potential for a future world dominated by design but without a designer in sight. Spurred on by both fear and curiosity, I have composed the argument I bring to you today.</p>
			<p>I’ll begin with a bit of my own history. In the early nineties, I began to specialize in design and writing projects working with novelists, linguists—anyone dealing predominantly with texts. At the time, digital writing was just emerging—it was called net.art because the literary world didn’t know what to do with it. It was the heyday of desktop publishing and hard-coded html. The digital writers I was working with were struggling to find a critical vocabulary to address the new electronic materiality of their writing. As a graphic designer, my training was in the visible and material form of language and so I became an advocate for the expertise of design and its relevance to this new work. Nevertheless, most of the literary discussion at that time touted the new capabilities of the author—thanks to the new digital tools, the writer could be a designer too.</p>
			<p>In the years that followed, net.art became e-lit—or electronic literature—and e-lit became multimodal scholarship. Recently, a well-funded new trajectory has appeared called the Digital Humanities. In the Digital Humanities, Humanities scholars have partnered with IT departments to develop new forms of digitally-based scholarly production such as open source journals, electronic hypertexts, short films, digital archives, information visualizations, and networked writing. Projects that were once dismissed by the traditional elders as net.art have moved to the center with institutional momentum. This is due, in part, to what some have declared a crisis of relevance: English majors are in decline, jobs for PhDs are scarcer. It appears that the Humanities is casting about for a new model. A 2004 policy document released by the Association of American Universities titled “Reinvigorating the Humanities” recommends that academic leaders support, among other things, digital information and technology to imbue the Humanities with contemporary significance.</p>
			<p>And yet the recognition of designers in this new domain hasn’t changed. Within the Digital Humanities, most scholars continue to design their own projects or to use research assistants or IT staff to do so. But the most troubling development is that these same scholars validate their approach by theorizing visual communication modes such as visual layout, the image, interaction, and multimedia with scant reference to the existing discourse within film, design, or the arts. In fact, most of the “design theory” that I come across in the Digital Humanities is generated by professors from English Literature, History, and Cultural Studies.</p>
			<p>Each time I am confronted by this activity, I am left with questions. What circumstances would lead a Professor of Education to develop a theory of multimodal discourse that is explicitly built around concepts from design without ever mentioning the value or expertise of an actual designer?4 Or how is it that a preeminent History Scholar would use motion graphics that his teenage son produced in After Effects as part of a scholarly presentation at a conference about the value of visual research? Surely he wouldn’t trust a high school student to do historical research or co-write a paper. Is it ignorance? Disciplinary bias? Not enough grant money? Or are designers to blame? Is our theory inadequate? Are the histories we have written relevant outside of our field?</p>
			<p>A similar shift is taking place across the Academy, a shift that mirrors a trend within the culture at large. An array of disciplines have turned to design as a stimulant or a strategy for increasing relevance. Sometimes it’s named design and sometimes it’s called studio-based learning, multimodal scholarship, or media literacy. Whatever you call it, it’s a version of design that can now be found within the Physics classroom, Education Theory, Ethnography and the Social Sciences, and, as we’ve seen, the scholarly production of Literature, Philosophy, and History.</p>
			<p>But it’s in Business Education that the attention to design is the most pronounced. For some time now, academics, business leaders, and journalists have celebrated Design as the savior for failing corporations, the secret of savvy managers, and the resurrection of the MBA. In some circles, the evangelism for “Design” and “Design Thinking” is so strong that I’ve heard the 21st century referred to, a bit prematurely, as the “Century of Design.”</p>
			<p>But in the Century of Design, “design” is not the discipline that we know and love—that is, it’s not the province of design practitioners, researchers, and educators. Instead, “Design” is variably a value-add, an everyday event, a working method, a byproduct, a literacy, and a complete abstraction. And frequently designers are nowhere to be found.</p>
			<p>Rather than bemoan our absence, it is useful to explore what kind of future this interest in Design—but not designers—portends for design and design education. Is the notion of the practitioner steeped purely in design a thing of the past? Is our scholarship too little and too late or just in the knick time? Will a formal design education be required for fields of all kinds? And what of the act of designing itself—will it be at the center of an epistemological shift or will it be relegated to a low-level service?</p>

			<h2 id="non-designers">What Non-Designers see in Design</h2>
			<p>Today I want to look at the confluence of forces that have brought us to this moment of spreading influence. In addition to the Digital Humanities, I will walk you through several other situations in which non-designers have incorporated aspects of design into their own fields. While I am aware that there is tremendous activity of this sort in the commercial arena, today I am focusing specifically on the work being done in the University. Design educators and practitioners who dismiss or ignore this activity do so at their own peril for each instance provides surprising insights into the power and definition of design while at the same time raising critical questions about our future.</p>
			<!-- Figure out how to show diagram -->
			<p>The diagram shown here indicates the aspects of design that were identified through the case studies that I will share with you today. Starting at the top and working clockwise, <strong>thinking</strong> refers to the generative and propositional act of ideation; <strong>making</strong> is the intentioned manipulation of materials and the creation of things; <strong>artifacts</strong> are finished, refined outcomes; <strong>tools</strong> are anything from soldering irons to Photoshop; <strong>methods</strong> refers to the iterative design process and applied problem-solving; and <strong>studio</strong> is the model of collaborative working in small groups. Just to be clear, this is not my version of design, rather it represents what this particular group of non-designers have seen in design.</p>
			<p>The case studies that follow are grouped according to how these aspects of design have been appropriated and put to use: Design as a Research Paradigm, Designing as a Way of Learning, Design as a Mindset, and Design as a Literacy.  It is my hope that these frameworks will allow designers to see and understand design beyond its commercial applications.</p>

			<h2 id="mindset">Design as a Mindset</h2>
			<p>By contrast, I’d like to look next at “Design Thinking” which has become tied closely to the innovation trend in Business. While there are many designers and design educators in the States who have built consultancies and programs around this notion, today I’d like to focus on how this idea is being used within business education, specifically within the Masters of Business Administration degree. As with the previous examples, my point here is to see what we can glean from the way in which a specific aspect of design is considered relevant to those outside of the design world.</p>
			<p>Roger Martin is the Dean of the <strong>Rotman School of Management  at the University of Toronto</strong> and is one of the most outspoken critics of traditional business school curricula. I am going to share <a class="embed-link" href="https://youtu.be/vJydmtRI-Z0?si=gWw6YVYBCMt4XGCV&t=161">a clip from an interview with Martin</a> in which he contrasts the dominant mindset in business with his version of Design Thinking. This video was put together for a small conference called  “Overlap 07: Exploring new methods for business and innovation.” The clip begins with Martin responding to the question: “why is there an overlap?” which refers to the overlap between business and design.</p>
			<p>Martin uses the idea of Design Thinking here to encourage business managers to shift from an analytic mindset to a generative, creative, and risk-taking one. Martin has identified within design a way of operating that he believes is more relevant to the messy realities of people, and, as a result, is more effective in the real world. </p>
			<p class="pullquote">So what are the implications for those of us engaged in the field of design? </p>
			<p>First, Martin’s comments provide an argument against design education that attempts to move design closer to empiricism and analytics, and argues for design to be all the more design-centric. But what is “design-centric”? Which aspects of what we do are quintessentially “design”? Is it the thinking, by which Martin appears to mean a kind of brainstorming approach to problem-solving? And if so, what of the artifacts and the making, the dominant activity that designers have historically undertaken to engage with the world?</p>
			<p>The term “Design Thinking” originated in an academic context from research into the cognition peculiar to designers. In the commercial world, it has become an easily-branded turn phrase that designers have been quick to use to place themselves at the center of the innovation trend. One of the most troubling outcomes of this uncritical adoption is the way in which the term has been used within the design community itself to establish a hierarchy between designers who operate strategically—ostensibly at a <em>higher</em> level—and those who do actual making and are considered to be merely “hands” whose work takes place “further downstream,” to use Martin’s words.</p>
			<p>Design Thinking sits squarely in a Cartesian world of divided minds and bodies in spite of the fact that recent advances in evolutionary theory and cognitive science point to the inseparability of what is called the “hand-brain complex.” Furthermore, the <em>embodied act</em> of “designing” is reduced to the <em>abstract concept</em> of “design.” As such, Design Thinking misses one of the most powerful aspects of design that was brought to life in the Design-Based Learning work we saw earlier: <em>the hands-on creation of material culture brings a depth of knowledge and understanding that cannot be achieved otherwise.</em></p>
			<p>The second, and perhaps more promising implication of Martin’s comments is the way in which he positions a design mindset in opposition to a scientific one, which echoes what we heard from the Learning Scientists using Design-Based Research. Could it be that we’re seeing early indications of a larger paradigm shift with design at the center? The interest in design methods comes predominantly from those working in disciplines with a social dimension for which quantitative scientific methods are proving to be inadequate. Are we witnessing the emergence of a new approach to research and knowledge? Or simply a passing trend?</p>
		</section>

			<h2 id="designers">What Designers see in Design</h2>
			<p>In all of the examples that we’ve seen today, the interest in design, whether stated explicitly or not, sees design and designing as a powerful way of operating that is in synch with emerging theories, that signifies a shift from scientific traditions, and that aligns fields with new technologies and cultural practices. In other words, <em>this thing called design appears to be well-suited to address our current moment.</em></p>
			<p>So it’s worth asking, what do Designers see in Design? On January 5, 2009, a group of leaders from the professional organizations of design who call themselves “The American Design Communities,” presented a document to the U.S. Congress called <em>Redesigning America’s Future: 10 design policy proposals for the United States of America’s economic competitiveness & democratic governance.</em> This is the first document of its kind in two decades. The U.S. has had no national design policy nor governmental support body since the Carter administration—this is clearly a significant step forward. The proposal was supported by every major design organization from the AIA to the AIGA. It begins thus:</p>
			<p class="pullquote">Design serves to advance the goals of the United States’ economic competitiveness by saving time and money and simplifying the use, manufacturing, and maintenance of goods and services. It enhances democratic governance by improving the performance and delivery of government services.</p>
			<p>So here we are—<em>Design</em>—possibly at the center of some kind of cultural revolution or  major paradigm shift and the best that the “American Design Communities” can do is to pitch design <em>as a service?!</em></p>
			<p>In the United States in particular, design’s rhetoric and self-definition has centered around its relevance to commerce. Design students are seldom taught to recognize or articulate their own unique expertise outside of their value to business. Our emphasis on design as a profession rather than as a discipline has left us without the scholarship that validates other fields. Our inability to advocate for design in larger terms excludes us from disciplinedefining, knowledge-producing, and policy-generating activities, especially within research, education, and government.</p>
			<p>Imagine how different the <em>Redesigning America’s Future</em> document might have been if its’ definition of design was not the packaging of products, goods, and services, but rather the shaping of culture, knowledge, and the human-made world, including commerce?</p>
			<p>This is why I am addressing my argument to educators. The academy is where a field is not only theorized and developed, but where the foundational assumptions of its new practitioners are built. The way in which design educators respond to this, “Design’s Big Moment,” is critical and will help determine the role of designers in the so-called Century of Design. For as we have seen, design expertise has increased in value at the same time that it is proliferating far and wide, eluding many designers along the way. I find this both exciting and terrifying at the same time.</p>
