			<h1>Design Without Designers</h1>
			<p class="author">Anne Burdick, 2009</p>

		<section>
			<p>Hello. The talk that I’m going to do today was initially prepared for a conference on the future of art and design education in the 21st century, held at the University of Brighton, in England. While speaking to a British audience, it became clear that my talk was really a rallying cry for the American design education community, none of whom happened to be in the audience at the time. So I’m happy to be able to deliver it here today where I hope to provoke educators into action—or at the very least begin a conversation.</p>
			<p>As the Chair of the graduate Media Design Program at Art Center College of Design, many assume that I bring a tech-oriented vision of the future. But surprisingly, the design futures that I foresee are not informed by work with alpha technologies, industry research labs, or human-centered research. Instead it is the work I do as a designer in the realms of computational linguistics, literary science, electronic literature, and media theory and criticism that has given me a glimpse of what may lie ahead. Within these scholarly communities I find myself in the role of design ambassador to fields that are undergoing transformation due to changes in technology, culture, and theory. And it is this experience that has shown me the potential for a future world dominated by design but without a designer in sight. Spurred on by both fear and curiosity, I have composed the argument I bring to you today.</p>
			<p>I’ll begin with a bit of my own history. In the early nineties, I began to specialize in design and writing projects working with novelists, linguists—anyone dealing predominantly with texts. At the time, digital writing was just emerging—it was called net.art because the literary world didn’t know what to do with it. It was the heyday of desktop publishing and hard-coded html. The digital writers I was working with were struggling to find a critical vocabulary to address the new electronic materiality of their writing. As a graphic designer, my training was in the visible and material form of language and so I became an advocate for the expertise of design and its relevance to this new work. Nevertheless, most of the literary discussion at that time touted the new capabilities of the author—thanks to the new digital tools, the writer could be a designer too.</p>
			<p>In the years that followed, net.art became e-lit—or electronic literature—and e-lit became multimodal scholarship. Recently, a well-funded new trajectory has appeared called the Digital Humanities. In the Digital Humanities, Humanities scholars have partnered with IT departments to develop new forms of digitally-based scholarly production such as open source journals, electronic hypertexts, short films, digital archives, information visualizations, and networked writing. Projects that were once dismissed by the traditional elders as net.art have moved to the center with institutional momentum. This is due, in part, to what some have declared a crisis of relevance: English majors are in decline, jobs for PhDs are scarcer. It appears that the Humanities is casting about for a new model. A 2004 policy document released by the Association of American Universities titled “Reinvigorating the Humanities” recommends that academic leaders support, among other things, digital information and technology to imbue the Humanities with contemporary significance.</p>
			<p>And yet the recognition of designers in this new domain hasn’t changed. Within the Digital Humanities, most scholars continue to design their own projects or to use research assistants or IT staff to do so. But the most troubling development is that these same scholars validate their approach by theorizing visual communication modes such as visual layout, the image, interaction, and multimedia with scant reference to the existing discourse within film, design, or the arts. In fact, most of the “design theory” that I come across in the Digital Humanities is generated by professors from English Literature, History, and Cultural Studies.</p>
			<p>Each time I am confronted by this activity, I am left with questions. What circumstances would lead a Professor of Education to develop a theory of multimodal discourse that is explicitly built around concepts from design without ever mentioning the value or expertise of an actual designer?4 Or how is it that a preeminent History Scholar would use motion graphics that his teenage son produced in After Effects as part of a scholarly presentation at a conference about the value of visual research? Surely he wouldn’t trust a high school student to do historical research or co-write a paper. Is it ignorance? Disciplinary bias? Not enough grant money? Or are designers to blame? Is our theory inadequate? Are the histories we have written relevant outside of our field?</p>
			<p>A similar shift is taking place across the Academy, a shift that mirrors a trend within the culture at large. An array of disciplines have turned to design as a stimulant or a strategy for increasing relevance. Sometimes it’s named design and sometimes it’s called studio-based learning, multimodal scholarship, or media literacy. Whatever you call it, it’s a version of design that can now be found within the Physics classroom, Education Theory, Ethnography and the Social Sciences, and, as we’ve seen, the scholarly production of Literature, Philosophy, and History.</p>
			<p>But it’s in Business Education that the attention to design is the most pronounced. For some time now, academics, business leaders, and journalists have celebrated Design as the savior for failing corporations, the secret of savvy managers, and the resurrection of the MBA. In some circles, the evangelism for “Design” and “Design Thinking” is so strong that I’ve heard the 21st century referred to, a bit prematurely, as the “Century of Design.”</p>
			<p>But in the Century of Design, “design” is not the discipline that we know and love—that is, it’s not the province of design practitioners, researchers, and educators. Instead, “Design” is variably a value-add, an everyday event, a working method, a byproduct, a literacy, and a complete abstraction. And frequently designers are nowhere to be found.</p>
			<p>Rather than bemoan our absence, it is useful to explore what kind of future this interest in Design—but not designers—portends for design and design education. Is the notion of the practitioner steeped purely in design a thing of the past? Is our scholarship too little and too late or just in the knick time? Will a formal design education be required for fields of all kinds? And what of the act of designing itself—will it be at the center of an epistemological shift or will it be relegated to a low-level service?</p>
			<h2>What Non-Designers see in Design</h2>
			<p>Today I want to look at the confluence of forces that have brought us to this moment of spreading influence. In addition to the Digital Humanities, I will walk you through several other situations in which non-designers have incorporated aspects of design into their own fields. While I am aware that there is tremendous activity of this sort in the commercial arena, today I am focusing specifically on the work being done in the University. Design educators and practitioners who dismiss or ignore this activity do so at their own peril for each instance provides surprising insights into the power and definition of design while at the same time raising critical questions about our future.</p>
			<!-- Figure out how to show diagram -->
			<p>The diagram shown here indicates the aspects of design that were identified through the case studies that I will share with you today. Starting at the top and working clockwise, <strong>thinking</strong> refers to the generative and propositional act of ideation; <strong>making</strong> is the intentioned manipulation of materials and the creation of things; <strong>artifacts</strong> are finished, refined outcomes; <strong>tools</strong> are anything from soldering irons to Photoshop; <strong>methods</strong> refers to the iterative design process and applied problem-solving; and <strong>studio</strong> is the model of collaborative working in small groups. Just to be clear, this is not my version of design, rather it represents what this particular group of non-designers have seen in design.</p>
			<p>The case studies that follow are grouped according to how these aspects of design have been appropriated and put to use: Design as a Research Paradigm, Designing as a Way of Learning, Design as a Mindset, and Design as a Literacy.  It is my hope that these frameworks will allow designers to see and understand design beyond its commercial applications.</p>

			<h2>Design as a Research Paradigm</h2>
			<p>In the Digital Humanities, design is practiced but seldom recognized as such. In contrast, there is emerging an explicit interest in design in the Social Sciences and Education.</p>
			<p><strong>The Center for Ethnography at the University of California at Irvine</strong> is currently running a discussion series called “Rethinking Ethnography as a Design Process.” In a recent e-mail, the Director of the Center, Professor George Marcus wrote: “I have a personal interest in how the terms and practices of the studio process and design thinking might influence the way ethnography as a distinctive form of inquiry is taught…. In dialogues… the figure of the design studio emerges as the medium that might improve/reform the classic practice of ethnography…. But aside from this, there is quite amazing and diverse interest in design at UCI among several disciplines and programs.”</p>
			<p>In the last year, conversations like these are popping up all over the place. Frequently the interest in design marks a shift within disciplines that are reconsidering traditional methods in light of changes in theory.</p>
			<p>One such example is <strong>Design-Based Research (DBR)</strong> which has grown in the last two decades in tandem with the field of Learning Science. In order to develop more relevant and sociallybased theories of learning, experimental and developmental psychologists have moved away from the isolation of the laboratory. Within the naturalistic research setting of the classroom, they are using the iterative, applied, problem-solving approaches used within design.</p>
			<p>Learning Scientists use the word ‘design’ to refer to the planning and creation of learning situations whose components may include teaching materials, tools, technologies, curricula, educational policies, social configurations, the physical environment, and specific teaching methods. A key aspect of this design-based approach is the progressive refinement of actual designs in context so that the outcomes are grounded in the complex and messy issues that impact learning in an actual classroom setting. While this is not a novel idea to anyone who is a professional designer, particularly for those involved in human-centered design research and co-design, it is a radical shift in the experimental science arena in which it lives.</p>
